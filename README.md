## Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for **Big-Math**, a large-scale, high-quality dataset designed specifically for RL training ([PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347), [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300), etc.) with large language models (LLMs).

This repository provides tools for reformulating multiple-choice questions and implementing rule-based and model-based filtering as described in the [Big-Math paper](https://alon-albalak.github.io/images/Big_MATH.pdf).

Find the dataset on HuggingFace at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/SynthLabsAI/Big-Math-RL-Verified](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SynthLabsAI/Big-Math-RL-Verified)


> [!WARNING]
> This repo is intended for research purposes, and is thus under constant development. Please expect major changes to the design.
> The primary goal of the big-math repo is to share the filtering and reformulation code for creating the Big-MATH dataset and to speed the development of future datasets.
> The Big-Math dataset is intended only for RL training of LLMs, it does not contain rollouts

## Repository Structure

This repo consists of 2 main directories: signals and reformulation.

### Signals

This folder contains code used to generate signals on a dataset. The below signals can be generated either using rule-based methods or model-based methods:

| Signal                | Rule-Based | Model-Based |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------|
| Hyperlink Detection       | âœ…         |             |
| Language Identification |          |    âœ…         |
| Semantic Duplicate       |          | âœ…            |
| Multiple Choice Question | âœ…       | âœ…        |
| Multi-Part Question     | âœ…         |  âœ…           |
| True/False Question       | âœ…         |   âœ…          |
| Yes/No Question     | âœ…     | âœ…    |
| Proof Detection       | âœ…         |   âœ…          |
| Model Solve Rate      |            | âœ…          |

### Reformulation

This folder contains code used to reformulate multiple choice problems to open-ended questions.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- python 3.10+
- install with packages in `signals/requirements.txt` to generate signals on a dataset
- install with packages in `reformulation/requirements.txt` to reformulate multiple choicen questions into open-ended questions

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/SynthLabsAI/big-math.git
        cd big-math
        ```
2. Install dependencies
        ```bash
        pip install -r signals/requirements.txt -r reformulation/requirements.txt
        ```

### ðŸ›  Usage

#### Reformulation
See [the reformulation readme](https://github.com/SynthLabsAI/big-math/blob/master/reformulation/README.md) for an explanation of files and usage.

#### Signals
See [the signals readme](https://github.com/SynthLabsAI/big-math/blob/master/signals/README.md) for an explanation of files and usage.
